# Simple-Email-App
This is a simple Api made to send emails. For this Api to create a free temporary email account in order to be the sender, i used the website : https://ethereal.email. 
The Username and Password of the email sender account are stored in appsettings.json file. In this example the receiver address is the same as the sender but it can be
changed to whatever you want. When changing the receiving address be sure to adjust the smtp Host, Port and Secure Socket Options accordingly.
